## [Unreleased]


### Added

- plugins: fully enabled, and ready for you to write some!
- plugins: `pay` is now a plugin.
- protocol: `pay` will now use routehints in invoices if it needs to.
- lightning-cli: `help <cmd>` finds man pages even if `make install` not run.
- JSON API: `waitsendpay` now has an `erring_direction` field.
- JSON API: `listpeers` now has a `direction` field in `channels`.
- JSON API: `listchannels` now takes a `source` option to filter by node id.
- JSON API: New command `paystatus` gives detailed information on `pay` commands.
- JSON API: `getroute` `riskfactor` argument is simplified; `pay` now defaults to setting it to 10.

### Changed

- The `short_channel_id` separator has been changed to be `x` to match the specification.
- JSON API: `listpeers` now includes `funding_allocation_msat`, which returns a map of the amounts initially funded to the channel by each peer, indexed by channel id.
- `option_data_loss_protect` is now enabled by default.
- JSON API: `help` with a `command` argument gives a JSON array, like other commands.
- build: we'll use the system libbase58 and libsodium if found suitable.

### Deprecated

Note: You should always set `allow-deprecated-apis=false` to test for
changes.

- JSON API: `short_channel_id` fields in JSON commands with `:` separators (use `x` instead).

### Removed

- JSON API: the `waitsendpay` command error return no longer includes `channel_update`

### Fixed

- Protocol: handling `query_channel_range` for large numbers of blocks
  (eg. 4 billion) was slow due to a bug.
- Fixed occasional deadlock with peers when exchanging huge amounts of gossip.
- You can no longer make giant unpayable "wumbo" invoices.
- CLTV of total route now correctly evaluated when finding best route.
- `riskfactor` arguments to `pay` and `getroute` now have an effect.

### Security

## [0.6.3] - 2019-01-09: "The Smallblock Conspiracy"

This release named by @molxyz and [@ctrlbreak](https://twitter.com/ctrlbreak).

### Added

- JSON API: New command `check` checks the validity of a JSON API call without running it.
- JSON API: `getinfo` now returns `num_peers` `num_pending_channels`,
  `num_active_channels` and `num_inactive_channels` fields.
- JSON API: use `\n\n` to terminate responses, for simplified parsing (pylightning now relies on this)
- JSON API: `fundchannel` now includes an `announce` option, when false it will keep channel private. Defaults to true.
- JSON API: `listpeers`'s `channels` now includes a `private` flag to indicate if channel is announced or not.
- JSON API: `invoice` route hints may now include private channels if you have no public ones, unless new option `exposeprivatechannels` is false.
- Plugins: experimental plugin support for `lightningd`, including option passthrough and JSON-RPC passthrough.

### Changed

- JSON API: `pay` and `decodepay` accept and ignore `lightning:` prefixes.
- pylightning: Allow either keyword arguments or positional arguments.
- JSON-RPC: messages are now separated by 2 consecutive newlines.
- JSON-RPC: `jsonrpc`:`2.0` now included in json-rpc command calls. complies with spec.

### Deprecated

Note: You should always set `allow-deprecated-apis=false` to test for
changes.

- pylightning: Support for pre-2-newline JSON-RPC (<= 0.6.2 lightningd) is deprecated.

### Removed

- option_data_loss_protect is now only offered if EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES is enabled, since it seems incompatible with lnd and has known bugs.

### Fixed

- JSON API: uppercase invoices now parsed correctly (broken in 0.6.2).
- JSON API: commands are once again read even if one hasn't responded yet (broken in 0.6.2).
- Protocol: allow lnd to send `update_fee` before `funding_locked`.
- Protocol: fix limit on how much funder can send (fee was 1000x too small)
- Protocol: don't send invalid onion errors if peer says onion was bad.
- Protocol: don't crash when peer sends a 0-block-expiry HTLC.
- pylightning: handle multiple simultanous RPC replies reliably.


### Security


## [0.6.2] - 2018-10-20: "The Consensus Loving Nasal Daemon"

This release named by practicalswift.

### Added

- JSON API: `listpeers` has new field `scratch_txid`: the latest tx in channel.
- JSON API: `listpeers` has new array `htlcs`: the current live payments.
- JSON API: `listchannels` has two new fields: `message_flags` and `channel_flags`. This replaces `flags`.
- JSON API: `invoice` now adds route hint to invoices for incoming capacity (RouteBoost), and warns if insufficient capacity.
- JSON API: `listforwards` lists all forwarded payments, their associated channels, and fees.
- JSON API: `getinfo` shows forwarding fees earnt as `msatoshi_fees_collected`.
- Bitcoind: more parallelism in requests, for very slow nodes.
- Testing: fixed logging, cleaner interception of bitcoind, minor fixes.
- Protocol: we set and handle the new `htlc_maximum_msat` channel_update field.

### Changed

- Protocol: `channel_update` sent to disable channel only if we reject an HTLC.
- Protocol: we don't send redundant `node_announcement` on every new channel.
- Config: config file can override `lightning-dir` (makes sense with `--conf`).
- Config: `--conf` option is now relative to current directory, not `lightning-dir`.
- lightning-cli: `help <cmd>` prints basic information even if no man page found.
- JSON API: `getinfo` now reports global statistics about forwarded payments, including total fees earned and amounts routed.

### Deprecated

Note: You should always set `allow-deprecated-apis=false` to test for
changes.

- JSON RPC: `listchannels`' `flags` field. This has been split into two fields, see Added.
- JSON RPC: `global_features` and `local_features` fields: use `globalfeatures` and `localfeatures` as per BOLT #1.

### Removed

- JSON API: the optional 'seed' parameter to `getroute` was removed.

### Fixed

- Startup: more coherent complaint if daemon already running.
- Lightningd: correctly save full HTLCs across restarts; fixup old databases.
- JSON RPC: `getinfo` now shows correct Tor port.
- JSON RPC: `ping` now works even after one peer fails to respond.
- JSON RPC: `getroute` `fuzzpercent` and `pay` `maxfeepercent` can now be > 100.
- JSON RPC: `riskfactor` in `pay` and `getroute` no longer always treated as 1.
- JSON-RPC: `listpeers` was always reporting 0 for all stats.
- JSON RPC: `withdraw all` says `Cannot afford transaction` if you have
             absolutely no funds, rather than `Output 0 satoshis would be dust`.
- Protocol: don't send gossip about closed channels.
- Protocol: fix occasional deadlock when both peers flood with gossip.
- Protocol: fix occasional long delay on sending `reply_short_channel_ids_end`.
- Protocol: re-send `node_announcement` when address/alias/color etc change.
- Protocol: multiple HTLCs with the same payment_hash are handled correctly.
- Options: 'autotor' defaults to port 9051 if not specified.

### Security

## [0.6.1] - 2018-09-11: "Principled Opposition To Segwit"

This release named by ZmnSCPxj.

### Added

- Protocol: gossipd now deliberately delays spamming with `channel_update`.
- Protocol: liveness ping when we commit changes but peer is idle: speeds up
  failures and reduces forced closures.
- Protocol: `option_data_loss_protect` now supported to protect peers
  against being out-of-date.
- JSON API: Added description to invoices and payments (#1740).
- JSON API: `getinfo` has new fields `alias` and `color`.
- JSON API: `listpeers` has new fields `global_features` and `local_features`.
- JSON API: `listnodes` has new field `global_features`.
- JSON API: `ping` command to send a ping to a connected peer.
- JSON API: `feerates` command to retrieve current fee estimates.
- JSON API: `withdraw` and `fundchannel` can be given manual feerate.
- Config: `--conf` option to set config file.
- Documentation: Added CHANGELOG.md
- pylightning: RpcError now has `method` and `payload` fields.
- Sending lightningd a SIGHUP will make it reopen its `log-file`, if any.

### Changed

- Protocol: Fee estimates are now smoothed over time, to avoid sudden jumps.
- Config: You can only announce one address if each type (IPv4, IPv6,
  TORv2, TORv3).
- lightning-cli: the help command for a specific command now runs the
  `man` command.
- HSM: The HSM daemon now maintains the per-peer secrets, rather than
  handing them out.  It's still lax in what it signs though.
- connectd: A new daemon `lightning_connectd` handles connecting
  to/from peers, instead of `gossipd` doing that itself. `lightning_openingd` now
  handles peers immediately, even if they never actually open a channel.
- Test: `python-xdist` is now a dependency for tests.
- Logging: JSON connections no longer spam debug logs.
- Routing: We no longer consider channels that are not usable either because of
  their capacity or their `htlc_minimum_msat` parameter (#1777)
- We now try to connect to all known addresses for a peer, not just
  the one given or the first one announced.
- Crash logs are now placed one-per file like `crash.log.20180822233752`
- We will no longer allow withdrawing funds or funding channels if we
  do not have a fee estimate (eg. bitcoind not synced); use new `feerate` arg.

### Deprecated

### Removed

- JSON API: `listpeers` results no long have `alias` and `color` fields;
  they're in `listnodes` (we used to internally merge the information).
- JSON API: `listpeers` will never have `state` field (it accidentally
  used to exist and set to `GOSSIPING` before we opened a channel).
  `connected` will indicate if we're connected, and the `channels`
  array indicates individual channel states (if any).
- Config: `default-fee-rate` is no longer available; use explicit `feerate`
  option if necessary.
- Removed all Deprecated options from 0.6.

### Fixed

- Protocol: `node_announcement` multiple addresses are correctly ordered and uniquified.
- Protocol: if we can't estimate feerate, be almost infinitely
  tolerant of other side setting fees to avoid unilateral close.
- JSON API: `listnodes`: now displays node aliases and colors even if they
  don't advertise a network address
- JSON API: `fundchannel all`: now restricts to 2^24-1 satoshis rather than failing.
- JSON API: `listnodes`: now correctly prints `addresses` if more than
  one is advertised.
- Config: `bind-addr` of a publicly accessible network address was announced.
- When we reconnect and have to retransmit failing HTLCs, the errors weren't
  encrypted by us.
- `lightningd_config` man page is now installed by `make install`.
- Fixed crash when shutting down during opening a channel (#1737)
- Don't lose track of our own output when applying penalty transaction (#1738)
- Protocol: `channel_update` inside error messages now refers to correct channel.
- Stripping type prefix from `channel_update`s that are nested in an onion reply
  to be compatible with eclair and lnd (#1730).
- Failing tests no longer delete the test directory, to allow easier debugging
  (Issue: #1599)
